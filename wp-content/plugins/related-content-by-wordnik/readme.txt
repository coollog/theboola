Keep users on your site longer. Introducing the fast, smart way to show related and trending content on your blog with thumbnail images or text.



== Description ==



Inspire yourself and your readers with content discovery: add related content to your posts automatically with thumbnails or plain text. Include recommendations only to your own content, or to that of friends and associates, or to any site at all. Reverb for Publishers includes related content on full posts on individual and home pages.

New: increase reader engagement with popular links in your sidebar. Reverb for Publishers now includes a Trending Links widget that displays the most popular posts from the past week. Keep your readers happy by keeping your most popular content within easy reach.

Reverb for Publishers also adds some magic to your blog with the new concept cloud. Reverb generates a list of concepts (people, places, and things) that are referenced in each post, and compiles them into a simple and elegant cloud. To add it to your blog, just drop the widget into the sidebar from your WordPress admin.


Reverb for Publishers is more than a simple related posts plugin. It is a new tool for publishers that increases reader engagement with your content. This plugin uses Reverb's proprietary concept graph technology to scan your blog, learn what it's about, and dynamically display the best related posts. This keeps readers happy and on the site longer, leading to higher page views and more time on site. Best of all, the processing takes place on Reverb's servers so your blog doesn't slow down at all.



Reverb for Publishers also helps with search engine optimization (SEO). Related links are indexable by search engines and can be used to evaluate page rankings in search results.




All the processing and heavy-lifting takes place on our servers -- not yours. Content recommendations are delivered asynchronously using advanced WebSocket technology so your page load time isn't affected.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= What does the Reverb for Publishers plugin do? =

Reverb for Publishers improves engagement on your site by automatically providing links to related content on each page or post of your site. This reveals to readers more content that they are likely to be interested in and more likely to click on -- all without having to search for it. These links highlight great posts from within your site or around the web, increasing visitors' time on site, pageviews, and engagement.

= How does Reverb for Publishers determine which links are the most popular? =

Reverb tracks visits to all pages and displays the most popular links from the past seven days.


= Does using Reverb for Publishers improve my SEO? =

Yes! Using Reverb for Publishers does help with SEO (search engine optimization) by providing you with more text links. These links are indexable by search engines and can improve your page rankings in search results.


= How does Reverb for Publishers decide which posts to recommend? =

Reverb for Publishers uses proprietary concept graph technology to analyze each page or post and determine how they're related. We don't take shortcuts like just using tags or categories - we actually analyze each page of content, including tags, title, categories, and body, and then see what other pages are similar to it.


= What kind of tracking analytics does Reverb for Publishers offer? =

Reverb will send you a weekly stats email detailing the number of visits, pageviews, and Reverb for Publishers links displayed. You'll also see the number of clicks those links received along with which link was the most clicked on and which link was the most recommended.


= What makes Reverb for Publishers different from other tools or plugins? =

Reverb for Publishers uses our patented concept graph technology to provide two key advantages over other systems: speed and intelligence. First, Reverb does all the heavy lifting on its own servers so it doesn't slow down your page load speed. Recommended pages are delivered asynchronously using advanced WebSocket technology. Second, Reverb for Publishers uses its proprietary concept graph technology to process and understand what each page is about. We don't take shortcuts like just using tags - we actually analyze each part of a page or post, including tags, title, categories, and body, and then find and display other pages similar to it.


= What display options do I have? =

Reverb for Publishers provides several display options. The default is to show links at the end of each post or page, including at the end of posts on home pages that display multiple full-length posts. In addition, you can display these links in a vertical list or horizontal rows. Currently, we automatically display thumbnail images if your site has images, and text-based links if you don't. Stay tuned - we're constantly working on new display alternatives, and we'll have more ways to tailor our tool soon.


= Does Reverb for Publishers affect my site load time? =

No. Reverb for Publishers offloads all the processing to Reverb's back-end servers, and then uses asynchronous WebSocket connections to make sure it won't slow down page loads at all.


= How soon will related content links show up on my site? =

After you've installed the Reverb for Publishers tool, it takes us 2-3 hours to process your site's content. You can always check your status on your Reverb for Publishers Dashboard.


= Does Reverb for Publishers work with Internet Explorer? =

Yes! Reverb for Publishers works with all browser types and will be able to process and analyze your site. However, some display options may not be available to readers who are using older versions of Internet Explorer.


= Why should I show recommendations to other sites? = 

Showing links from both within your site and across the web enables your site to be seen as the epicenter of expertise on content related to your topic. Don't forget that other sites will show links back to your site.


= Does Reverb for Publishers support non-English sites? =

Currently, Reverb for Publishers only supports English-language sites. We are evaluating supporting other language options and will let you know as soon as we expand our coverage.


= Why is registration required? =
Registration is free and easy, and it helps our servers keep track of your site (or blog) and remember your settings. Once you've registered, you can dynamically adjust these settings without having to change any code or anything on your site. Finally, it helps us keep you up-to-date with the latest improvements and changes in Reverb for Publishers.


= Can I use my Reverb account to login to Related Content? =

No. Right now the two systems are separate and you'll need to create a separate account for Related Content.


= I just activated Reverb for Publishers but don't see anything, what's up? =

Please give us a couple of hours to make sure we've processed your blogs. If waiting doesn't fix things, shoot us an email at publishers@reverb.com and we'll figure it out ASAP.


= Does Reverb for Publishers work with my theme? =

We make every effort to support all common WordPress themes, and we try to let you know if there's any doubt for your particular theme. If you a specific question, please let us know at <a href="mailto:publishers@reverb.com">publishers@reverb.com</a>.


= I've installed the plugin, registered, but still no content is showing up, what gives? =
