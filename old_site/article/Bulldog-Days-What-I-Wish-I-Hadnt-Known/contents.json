{"title":"Bulldog Days: What I Wish I Hadn't Known","author":"Karin Shedd","date":"April 19, 2014","text":"Reminiscing on a former lack of knowledge is a proud tradition of people who like to share their thoughts on the Internet. For those of us who like to neurotically pregame life through our computer screens, &ldquo;things I wish I had known&rdquo; articles and videos exist for virtually any topic, like marriage, prom, different phases of being a twentysomething, making your sexual debut, and, most relevantly to any prefrosh reading this, what to know before entering college.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut don&rsquo;t bother clicking any of the hyperlinks above to see if they lead to advice for Bulldog Days, dear prefrosh, because all the information you need is below: this is the definitive guide to the knowledge we all wish we&rsquo;d had (or not) during BDD.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>1. College Confidential<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you somehow managed to avoid desperately Google-searching something like &ldquo;will I get into Yale???&rdquo; during your application season, allow me to explain. Collegeconfidential.com is the cesspool of narcissism and panic where uppity applicants and\/or their helicopter parents congregate to post their &ldquo;stats&rdquo; (standardized test scores, GPAs, and extracurricular activities), propagate culturally-insensitive myths about the admissions process (&ldquo;my friend faked being 1\/32 Cherokee and got in to all the ivies!&rdquo;), and, after admissions day, masturbate their egos under the guise of humility (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so surprised I got in, lol sorry plebs who didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDon&rsquo;t let College Confidential and its cohorts (looking at you, Yahoo answers) trick you into thinking you&rsquo;re a subpar prefrosh surrounded by Olympic athletes\/chess masters\/founders of successful charities with perfect SAT scores, more interesting ethnicities, and application essays featured in The New Yorker. That&rsquo;s only, like, half of them. The rest are just like you!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/cdn.makeagif.com\/media\/4-14-2014\/zx9P7Q.gif'><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>2. Metro North\/Amtrak<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is one goes out to my prefrosh compatriots who come from places where trains exclusively transport cows or whatever the local agriculture product is. Here in New England \u0096 where public transit exists in more forms than just that one taxi you rarely see driving around town \u0096 trains carry people, too! But not at all like the Hogwarts Express, zipping along the scenic English countryside with a catering service and menagerie of magical people and their exotic pets. No, the Metro North and Amtrak lines are a little less magical and a little more soul-crushing. This will likely be mentioned in at least one conversation with a fellow prefrosh, and more if you happen to find yourself hanging out with a bunch of people from New York City (also known as &ldquo;the city.&rdquo; Never &ldquo;NYC&rdquo;). If one of your new friends complains about &ldquo;how the Metro North broke down right outside of Fairfield,&rdquo; just nod in agreement and offer an empathetic &ldquo;yeah, that sucks.&rdquo;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dBNKQ.gif '><br \/>\r\n<i>We are in complete agreement.<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>3. Fraternities<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI&rsquo;m still unsure about this one. If you&rsquo;re like I was during Bulldog Days, you&rsquo;re probably too busy shitting your pants with shock and awe that you&rsquo;re here to have time to go to any parties (also you&rsquo;re too shy and awkward, and that&rsquo;s okay). Three years later, though, I still only know where one frat house is because of that one tragicomical night I spent chasing down an unrequited love interest. I have no advice for you on this one, prefrosh. You&rsquo;re on your own.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y2Zwk.gif'><br \/>\r\n<i>Idk, frats?<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>4. Gilmore Girls<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nImportant disclaimer: Gilmore Girls remains one of my favorite shows of all time. <br \/>\r\nThat being said, if you&rsquo;re coming to Yale hoping to be the next Rory Gilmore, go ahead and let go of that pipe dream right now. It&rsquo;s simply not possible for a plethora of different reasons:<br \/>\r\na. The city of New Haven exists here in reality, unlike in the Gilmore universe. Embrace it.<br \/>\r\nb. Coffee carts will not appear right outside your dorm room. It might be a taco cart or a kettle corn cart, though, if you live in Trumbull, Saybrook, or Berkeley!<br \/>\r\nc. Freshmen who live in Durfee are in Morse, not Branford (but Robert Frost really did say that bit about Branford being the oldest and most beautiful at Yale).<br \/>\r\nd. No one looks as put-together as Rory Gilmore all the time. Even the best-dressed people you meet will occasionally inhabit a Bass Library cubicle in their schlumpiest sweatpants.<br \/>\r\ne. It is absolutely not possible to take off a full semester, be the editor of the Yale Daily News, maintain a successful years-long committed relationship, infiltrate Skull and Bones, and still graduate with honors on time all in one career at Yale.<br \/>\r\nBut don&rsquo;t despair, Gilmore fans! It&rsquo;s absolutely possible to find your own Logan Huntzberger, crash one of his family yacht parties, steal a yacht, and get arrested for grand-theft boating! Those people definitely exist here, you just have to find them. Maybe check the frat houses? Again, I don&rsquo;t know.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/cdn4.gurl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/gilmoregirlsgif.gif'><br \/>\r\n<i>And, ideally, that person has a yacht.<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>5. Disney parties<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSomeday, prefrosh, you might receive an anonymous email inviting you to a Disney party. They&rsquo;re a whole new world, these Disney parties. They exist not just around the riverbend, but, rather, in an off-campus house. They won&rsquo;t teach you to paint with all the colors of the wind, you probably won&rsquo;t get to kiss the girl, and they likely won&rsquo;t make a man out of you, so you need to be prepared for that. If you just can&rsquo;t wait to be king of the social scene, you could try to go the distance to attend a Disney party, but to the rest of you: just let it go. Let it go, let it go, turn away and slam the door&hellip;on the idea of a Disney party.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/29.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_liqmx5OkNx1qadlzho1_500.gif'><br \/>\r\n<i>It was a naked party. That&rsquo;s what it was. A naked party. Maybe leave that until your freshmen year, at least.<\/i>","img":"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OmINZiU.jpg","summary":"Dear prefrosh, all the information you need is below: this is the definitive guide to the knowledge we all wish we&rsquo;d had (or not) during BDD.","keywords":"bulldog days, prefrosh"}
