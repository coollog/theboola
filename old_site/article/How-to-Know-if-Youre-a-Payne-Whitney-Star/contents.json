Whether you play a varsity sport, frequent the IM fields, or run up\/down Science Hill twice a day in between classes, many of us enjoy the benefits of rigorous physical activity. But, how do you see yourself? Do you consider yourself a gym-rat? Do you feel that climbing the three stairs to your first-floor room constitutes enough muscle exertion on a daily basis?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>1. The Payne Whitney Singlet-Guy\u0085. +1 <\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/worthopedia.s3.amazonaws.com'><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you know who this guy is without further explanation and no longer do a double-take when he walks into Payne Whitney&rsquo;s 4th floor gym, take a point! If you don&rsquo;t know Singlet-Guy, in short, he is a short, bald man with glasses who wears a one-piece American flag wrestling singlet every time he works out. Oh, and he&rsquo;s EXTREMELY RIPPED! Like, HOLY SHIT dude&rsquo;s at bodybuilder level. There&rsquo;s been some speculation about roid-usage, but we&rsquo;re not going to address that here.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>2.

I imagine that they&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;Wow, that guy must be super-athletic to go to the gym AND still have the energy to take the stairs.&rdquo;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>3.
