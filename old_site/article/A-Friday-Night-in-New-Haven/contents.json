{"title":"A Friday Night in New Haven","author":"Maggie Green","date":"April 5, 2014","text":"It&rsquo;s been a miserable and dreary winter for most of Yale.  But for many seniors like myself, this has been a miserable and dreary winter filled with an impossible amount of alcohol.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMost of this intoxication is thanks to Feb Club.   This long-standing Yale tradition was started by wonderful, upstanding students Doug Green, Dave Bass, Andy Haas, Gary Sweeney, Jim Burnham, and Steve Fox in Room 685 (lol what?) of JE in 1975 (Source: the comment from my dad on a Facebook wall post I left him in February 2013).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kwRcuLZ.jpg'><br \/>\r\n<i>Original All-Star wearing original Feb Club required attire.<br \/>\r\nSource: facebook.com<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut Feb Club isn&rsquo;t where the alcohol ends.  There&rsquo;s also senior happy hours, wine and cheese events, fellows&rsquo; dinners, and the giant bottle of Moscato my suite mate purchased to numb the pain of thesis writing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile I prefer to take my SWUGness to heart and sit in sweatpants in my best friend&rsquo;s common room on a Friday night, I occasionally decide that it&rsquo;s time for a good, old-fashioned bar crawl.  A bar crawl that usually ends with my friends being too drunk to function, and me wanting to purchase 100 shots just to throw them in their faces.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/M76A9WO.gif'><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Q8mIpdL.gif'><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TcC1bMg.gif'><br \/>\r\n<i>&ldquo;Rude.&rdquo;<br \/>\r\nSource: tumblr.com<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere&rsquo;s my play-by-play of a recent Friday night out in the crazy streets of the Have:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>10:00pm<\/b>: Begin pregame, aka drinking PBRs alone in my room while blasting Ke$ha and Queen Bey and applying mascara.
